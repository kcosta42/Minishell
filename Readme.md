Minishell
=========

About
-----

>Minishell is the first of 3 projects dedicated to the realization of a fully functional shell.

* In this project many features were implemented:
    * Rewriting of the builtins `echo`, `cd`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`, `env` and `exit`.
    * Cursor without the use of `termcaps`.
    * A command history.
    * A simple yet functional auto-complete.

Installation
------------

Run `make -C Minishell/ fclean && make -C Minishell/`.

Usage
-----

`./minishell`

That's pretty much all.
