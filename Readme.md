This is the second project of the Unix branch at School 42 Paris

  * Rewriting of the builtins `echo`, `cd`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`, `env` and `exit`.
  * Cursor without the use of `termcaps`.
  * A command history.
  * A simple yet functional auto-complete.

Installation
------------
Run `make fclean && make`.
